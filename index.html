          My name is Amina, I enjoy practicing yoga everyday to get my energy flowing, rest assured the day goes by pretty smooth if I get to pray all my Salawat in time and stick to my diet plan.

        <div id="div-2" class="about-me">
        For someone who loves to eat &lpar;which one of us doesn't duh!&rpar; I wasn't blessed with a strong metabolism but that's okay because all of us lack one thing or the other. So, one of my biggest goals in life is to stay fit and do what's right for my body.

        <div id="div-3" class="about-me">
        Trees, mountains, fresh air, the sun: Aaah all of these are one of the best things in life! I always find joy in admiring nature's beauty, from the heavenly floating clouds in the sky to the tiniest lovely flower by the sidewalk.
